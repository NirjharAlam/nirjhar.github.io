## Bio


I am a 5th year PhD student at Pennsylvania State University's Material Science Department. I employ data and physics-driven techniques to decipher critical information from radar scattering data. This portfolio contains glimpses of my published work, as well as projects that are either in progress or were not substantial enough for separate publication, yet interesting. 


## Publications
- **Data-driven evaluation of building materials using Ground Penetrating Radare**  
  A data-driven approach for predicting material type and layer thickness from GPR radargrams is proposed. The methodology also successfully detects sub-wavelength thicknesses. [Read more](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235271022401756X).

- **ASCE Engineering Mechanics Institute 2024 Conference**  
  Brief description of the presentation. [Abstract (see page 8)](https://www.asce.org/-/media/798f777f1bb446ceb8a290267b11cb79.ashx)


## Works in Progress
- **GPR Scan Inversion Using Deep Neural Network**  
  A generative model is used to fully inverst GPR B-scans for a buried object problem. A relatively light VAE model accurately indicates the object position and size, although results inconclusive for when the buried object is small.  [See project details](./DNN-inversion/README.md).

- **Orientation Detection for Angular Defectss in Building Envelopes**  
  Short description. [See project details](https://nirjharalam.github.io/triangular_defect/).
