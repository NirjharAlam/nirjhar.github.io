# Ahmed Nirjhar Alam's Portfolio

## Bio
![Ahmed Nirjhar Alam](./assets/img/rougn_snip.png)
I am a 5th year PhD student at Pennsylvania State University's Material Science Department. I employ a mix of data and physics-driven techniques to decipher critical information from radar scattering data. This portfolio contains glimpses of my published work, as well as projects which are either in progress or were not substantial enough for separate publication, but yet interesting. 


## Publications
- **Data-driven evaluation of building materials using Ground Penetrating Radare**  
  A data driven approach for predicting material type and layer thickness from GPR radargrams is proposed. The methodology also successfully detects sub-wavelength thicknesses. [Read more](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235271022401756X).
